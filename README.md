### Headunit for Android Auto (tm)

A new car or a $600+ headunit is NOT required to enjoy the integration and distraction reduced environment of Android Auto.

This headunit app can turn a Android 4.1+ tablet supporting USB Host mode into a basic Android Auto compatible headunit.

Current release is highly experimental. Some features, such as voice input and phone calls, are not yet supported.

The Headunit app should only be used for testing at this time. Do not use while driving. You assume all responsibility.
